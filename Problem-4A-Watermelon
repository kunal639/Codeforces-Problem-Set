// Solution Approach:

// 1. Check for even weight: If the watermelon weight (w) is even, it cannot be split into two parts with even weights while maintaining an odd total weight.

// 2. Special case: If w is equal to 2, it's impossible to achieve the desired split.

// 3. Possible division: For any other odd w or even w greater than 2, it's possible to split the watermelon into two even parts (e.g., 4 kg can be split into 2 kg and 2 kg).

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int w; //Declaring a variable to store the weight of the watermelon.
    cin >> w;  //Take the weight input
    if(w>2) //Checking the case if the weight of the watermelon is not equal to 2 kg.
    {
        if(w%2==0)
        {
        cout << "YES" << endl;  // Possible to split
        }
        else
        {
        cout << "NO" << endl;  // Not possible to split
        }
    }
    else
    {
        cout << "NO" << endl;  // Not possible to split as the weight was equal to 2 kg.
    }
    return 0;
}
